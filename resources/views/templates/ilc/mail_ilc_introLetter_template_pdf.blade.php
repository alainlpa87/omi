    We would like to take this moment to congratulate you on your patent (or patent pending) status and formally
    welcome you to <span style="color:#008000">International Licensing Consultants</span>. We are an independent licensing agency, which often acquires
    portfolios like yours from patent assistance companies. ILC specializes in submitting products to industry, licensing
    negotiation services support, and education and assistance in the marketing of patented or patent pending inventions to
    industry. ILC will only accept clients who have a verifiable U.S. or International patent (pending) status, and have received a
    favorable product evaluation from a reputable independent third party. ILC performs licensing services on a contingency
    basis to select clientele acquired from our affiliated companies, meaning there are no upfront fees to these inventors for the
    services offered in our licensing agreement.
