<p class="pSmall">Please be advised, the United States Patent and Trademark Office has found your Trademark too closely
    descriptive of your actual invention. Therefore, registration for your trademark will be refused.</p>
<p class="pSmall">If the Trademark merely describes the goods or services, then it is too closely descriptive and will
    be rejected.  For example, trying to trademark "snow shovel" for a snow shovel, or "car jack" for a car jack, will
    not work.  The trademark should NOT give any indication of the goods being offered for sale.  Examples of excellent
    trademarks would be the following: “Apple" for computers or "Nissan" for cars, or "BIC" for ink pens, or "Sharpie"
    for a yellow highlighter. </p>
<p class="pSmall">
    The Independent Registered Patent Attorney has prepared and submitted preliminary Trademark information and requires
    this additional supporting document.  In order to complete the final phase of your application to the United States
    Patent and Trademark Office, the Registered Patent Attorney is requesting this “time-sensitive” information from you,
    in order to avoid any future filing inconsistencies and to expedite your filing promptly.  The attorney requires this
    completed information returned to us as soon as possible.
