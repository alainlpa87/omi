Such a legal opinion can save you money and time by helping you decide whether it makes sense to apply for a patent for your invention idea or not.

Furthermore, if you decide to proceed with filing a patent application, the legal opinion can increase the chances of success and can also decrease the cost, effort & number of prosecutions by highlighting elements of your invention that are, indeed, patentable. Lastly, a legal opinion can also provide potential defense support in case of any lawsuits are brought against you in the future for patent infringement.

At Patent Services USA, all our patent searches carry the objective legal opinion of a licensed US Based patent attorney (who can practice at the USPTO) behind it.
