                <p class="pSmall text-left wow fadeInUp delay-02s">I fully understand that submitting my idea, product or new to invention Patent Services IS NOT A RELEASE. I further understand that Patent Services will not, under any circumstance, use, disclose, assign, modify or solicit my idea, product or new invention to any other individual, organization, corporation or entity without my expressed written and verbal authorization. I also acknowledge that all employees, contractors, affiliates and representatives of Patent Services have voluntarily signed a confidentiality agreement for my privacy and protection. I hereby acknowledge that Patent Services does not engage in the business of invention development or marketing services and, to the best of our knowledge, understand that Patent Services is not required under any state law to file a disclosure statement. I also understand that Patent Services strongly encourages all inventors, as well as, its clients to obtain disclosure statements from companies they chose to do business with. To the best of my knowledge, I am the original inventor / innovator of the product idea being described and submitted to Patent Services. I, therefore, authorize Patent Services to contact me for the purpose of providing me with a no-charge consultation and discussion about my product. I understand that I am under no obligation to purchase any product or service from Patent Services. I also understand after further review and discovery that my idea may already be publicly known at the time of disclosure, through no fault of Patent Services, or may already be known to Patent Services prior to submission. I also understand that Patent Services may learn about exact, or similar, products or designs through legitimate third party contacts through the course of conducting regular business communications.</p>

                <p class="pSmall text-left fadeInUp delay-02s wow">Patent Services is a CLEARINGHOUSE for many different services â€“ outsourcing work to colleges and universities, bonded draftsmen, graphic designers, Independent Registered patent attorneys and Independent Licensing Affiliates. We do not hire Registered Patent Attorneys and/or Registered Patent Agents on staff and do not render any legal services or legal advice. Patent Services is not attorney owned nor are we a legal services firm of any kind. This will assure our clients that delivered results are 3rd party, independently generated and unbiased. Only an Independent Registered Patent Attorney may represent an inventor before the United States Patent and Trademark Office and its examiners.</p>
