<p class="verySmall">
    This Agreement for Patent Services (the "Agreement") is entered into by and between <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<?php echo e($attorney->fname."

        <?php if(strlen($project->coInventor)!=0): ?>
            and <u class="verySmall"><?php echo e($project->coInventor); ?></u>
        <?php endif; ?>
    </strong> residing at the address of <strong><u class="verySmall"><?php echo e(isset($client->street)?$client->street." ".$client->street2:"address"); ?></u></strong> ("INVENTOR").  By executing this
    agreement, INVENTOR represents that all parties with any ownership or security interest (by way of example and not limitation, other inventors or
    assignees) in any property involved in this engagement are parties to this Agreement.
</p>
<p><strong><u class="verySmall">1. Scope of Professional Services-</u></strong></p>
<p class="verySmall">
    Unless otherwise indicated in a separate written addendum countersigned by the parties, PATENT FIRM is hereby
    retained by INVENTOR solely to provide United States Patent and Trademark Office (the "USPTO") patent application and
    prosecution services and to perform other activities reasonably related thereto (the "Patent Services"). The terms of this Agreement
    will govern all Patent Services undertaken by PATENT FIRM for INVENTOR. PATENT FIRM works on behalf of INVENTOR,
    and not any of INVENTOR’s agents or any individuals associated with INVENTOR.
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    PATENT FIRM shall endeavor to provide INVENTOR with effective and efficient Patent Services. PATENT FIRM will
    also take reasonable steps to keep INVENTOR informed of their matters related to the Patent Services. If INVENTOR at any time
    has any questions or concerns, please contact PATENT FIRM. Due to the unpredictable nature of patent prosecution matters,
    PATENT FIRM makes no representations, warranties, promises or guarantees to INVENTOR about the outcome of INVENTOR's
    matters related to the Patent Services provided hereunder.
</p>
<p><strong><u  class="verySmall">AGENTS OF INVENTOR</u></strong></p>
<p class="verySmall">
    Initially it is expected that INVENTOR will be represented by Patent Services USA, Inc. of Florida as INVENTOR's agent
    (here in "AGENT"). Given that INVENTOR is engaging PATENT FIRM through AGENT representing INVENTOR then
    PATENT FIRM and INVENTOR acknowledge that AGENT is INVENTOR's representative and properly providing any fees
    and/or instructions to PATENT FIRM, which PATENT FIRM always assumes, in good faith, are completely according to
    INVENTOR's knowledge and wishes. Hence, INVENTOR takes official notice that compensation to PATENT FIRM for all work
    under this agreement is provided by INVENTOR's AGENT, and not INVENTOR. INVENTOR acknowledges all service fees paid
    to PATENT FIRM by AGENT are specially arranged flat-fees for specifically procured patent services as SET ON PAGE THREE, which flat fees are earned
    upon receipt, thus no special trust account segregation or hourly billing/invoice accounting is required under 37 CFR 10.112(c).
    INVENTOR acknowledges that PATENT FIRM has provided disclosure of this relationship to INVENTOR under 10.68(a)(1) and
    INVENTOR accordingly provides full consent to PATENT FIRM to be so compensated by such AGENT of INVENTOR. Both
    PATENT FIRM and INVENTOR acknowledge that all of the foregoing provisions and understandings shall transfer to any newly
    appointed agent(s) of INVENTOR. INVENTOR agrees to consult exclusively with AGENT regarding any counseling or questions
    related to the nature, timing, or requirements to establish or maintain any US or foreign patent rights.
</p>
<p><strong><u  class="verySmall">2. Other INVENTOR's; Conflicts.</u></strong></p>
<p class="verySmall">
    INVENTOR understands, agrees and acknowledges that PATENT FIRM represents a wide range of INVENTOR's, some
    of which may be or become customers, vendors, or competitors of INVENTOR. It is possible that at some point during the course
    of PATENT FIRM's representation of INVENTOR, a conflict could arise between INVENTOR and PATENT FIRM's other
    INVENTOR's. If you are concerned about any relationships we might have with particular companies or individuals, please bring
    those concerns to our attention.
</p>

<p class="verySmall">
    Patent Services USA frequently retain the above counsel for patent related services and has an ongoing business relationship with this law firm, we provide these attorneys substantial amount of work. However, pursuant to attorney code of ethics our patent attorneys are required to use their own judgment and should not be influenced by the amount of work that is provided to them by Patent Services USA.
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    You should feel free to confirm with the patent attorney handling your work that they are exercising independent legal judgment.
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    By signing this letter of engagement, you consent to and waive any potential conflict that could arise the law firm representation and ongoing business relationship with Patent Services USA. This expressly includes the fact that law firm’s personal financial interest creates a potential conflict.
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    Should PATENT FIRM discover, at any time, a potential conflict which under applicable law would prevent PATENT
    FIRM from providing Patent Services to INVENTOR it will promptly bring the matter to INVENTOR's attention. By signing this
    agreement, INVENTOR agrees that PATENT FIRM may represent companies in any way that does not present a direct subject
    matter conflict which under applicable law would prevent PATENT FIRM from providing Patent Services to INVENTOR.
</p>
<p ><strong><u  class="verySmall">3. Confidentiality</u></strong></p>
<p class="verySmall">
    INVENTOR may wish to deliver to PATENT FIRM such proprietary and confidential information and materials as INVENTOR desires to disclose
    for the sole purpose of allowing PATENT FIRM to provide the Patent Services. In accordance with the attorney/agent-INVENTOR relationship,
    this any such information is privileged information.
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    INVENTOR agrees and acknowledges that it is in INVENTOR's best interests to preserve the confidentiality of all communications between
    PATENT FIRM and INVENTOR. If INVENTOR discloses these communications to any third-party, INVENTOR jeopardizes the privileged nature
    of the communications. PATENT FIRM hereby advises INVENTOR not to disclose privileged information to any third parties and INVENTOR
    does so at its own peril.

<p><strong><u class="verySmall">4. General Notices</u></strong></p>
<p class="verySmall">
    TERMINATION; REJECTION:
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    Upon termination or rejection of this Agreement for any reason, INVENTOR may request an updated agreement from PATENT FIRM; provided,
    however, that (a) PATENT FIRM shall have no obligation to furnish said updated agreement and (b) all terms and conditions contained in any
    updated agreement are subject to change in PATENT FIRM's sole discretion.
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    MASTER AGREEMENT:
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    This Agreement shall serves as a master agreement between the parties. Unless otherwise quoted in writing by PATENT FIRM, each project, task,
    or patent application and/or prosecution services INVENTOR project shall be quoted or estimated separately in writing and must be individually
    negotiated between PATENT FIRM and INVENTOR based on the then-current fee schedule as published on PATENT FIRM's web site. Unless
    otherwise stated expressly in writing, all Patent Services related to all INVENTOR Project shall be governed by this Agreement and any such
    writing shall be deemed an addendum to this Agreement.
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    FOREIGN PATENT RIGHTS:
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    INVENTOR agrees and acknowledges that INVENTOR has 12 months from the filing date of a provisional patent application ("PPA") with the
    USPTO to file a patent application abroad or under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (the "PCT") to preserve the right to priority under the Paris
    Convention based on the filing date of the PPA. INVENTOR agrees and acknowledges that if no PPA was filed by INVENTOR, the 12-month
    priority deadline under the Paris Convention is measured from the earliest USPTO effective filing date of any non-provisional patent application
    filed by INVENTOR. Any PCT filings desired by INVENTOR should be procured by INVENTOR within 10 months after the earliest U.S. filing
    date and may be subject to a separate written agreement between the parties. INVENTOR agrees to consult exclusively with AGENT regarding any
    counseling or questions related to the nature, timing, or requirements of any foreign patent applications.
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    EFFORT:
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    PATENT FIRM will attempt to obtain a patent on behalf of INVENTOR by negotiating with the USPTO using patent law and related procedures,
    but does not guarantee that a strong patent, or any patent, will be allowed by the USPTO. Moreover, INVENTOR agrees and acknowledges that the
    quality (by way of example, and not limitation, patent scope and effectiveness in litigation or licensing), likelihood of allowance, and/or validity of
    any patent application and/or prosecution service tends to be at least commensurate with the novelty, strength and scope of INVENTOR's invention
    disclosure submitted. To that end, INVENTOR agrees to work with AGENT to establish INVENTOR’s top invention protection priorities to claim
    (usually the top three most valuable) and INVENTOR's most basic (i.e., broadest), yet novel, invention version. The Utility patent application
    prepared by PATENT FIRM will typically include 10 to 20 claims, which PATENT FIRM will make best efforts to formally draft to at least cover
    such top invention claim priorities, and likewise for the supporting patent specification. When retained for patent prosecution work, PATENT
    FIRM will likewise make best efforts to win patent protection which at least consist of claiming INVENTOR's detailed invention design and/or all
    stated protection priorities and/or all stated novelties. If any known, INVENTOR agrees to work with AGENT to identify and provide the closest
    known prior art which is required to be cited to the USPTO; wherein, in none received, PATENT FIRM assume there is no known prior art to be
    cited. INVENTOR agrees and acknowledges that PATENT FIRM shall assume that the claim priorities provided by INVENTOR have been
    sufficiently narrowed to focus on strong, core novelties and avoid any known prior art.
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    TYPES OF PATENT PROTECTION:
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    Ornamental designs that have only aesthetic, visual qualities are protected by Design Patents, and inventions that have functional usefulness that
    solve some kind of problem are protected by Utility patents. It is common to protect the function or manufacture of an article with a Utility patent,
    and the outward appearance of the same article with a Design patent. Generally, design patents protect the same or obvious variations to the look of
    the article, whereby the functionality of the article is not relevant. INVENTOR acknowledges that often Design patents have more limited value
    especially relative to Utility patents.

<div class="page-break"></div>
<!--page 3-->
<p class="verySmall">
    DRAWINGS:
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    PATENT FIRM shall use best efforts to ensure that all formal drawings created and provided by PATENT FIRM will be accepted by the USPTO.
    Any corrections to these drawings required by the USPTO will be at PATENT FIRM's expense. However, drawings provided by INVENTOR or a
    draftsman hired by INVENTOR are not guaranteed by PATENT FIRM in any way and INVENTOR shall be solely responsible for their acceptance
    by the USPTO. Any work required by PATENT FIRM to complete and/or formalize such drawings will be at additional charge, which will be
    quoted by PATENT FIRM to INVENTOR and paid by INVENTOR to PATENT FIRM within 30 days of receipt of such quote. PATENT FIRM
    shall have no obligation to complete and/or formalize any such drawing unless and until payment is received from INVENTOR. In some cases, it
    may be advisable to formalize a drawing professionally. If professional drawings are required, PATENT FIRM would be happy to make
    recommendations to INVENTOR. Notwithstanding the foregoing, INVENTOR shall be solely responsible for any such professional drawings and
    any related third-party fees.
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    PRIOR ART:
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    Under applicable United States patent law (including 35 U.S.C. §102 (b)), INVENTOR acknowledges that INVENTOR has a duty to inform the
    USPTO if any events or circumstances occurred more than a year prior to filing a PPA or non-provisional patent application with USPTO. Such
    events include,
</p>

<p class="verySmall">but are not limited to: INVENTOR's invention that is the subject of a PPA or non-provisional patent application was (a) sold or
    offered for sale in the U.S., (b) described in a printed publication or claimed in a patent anywhere, or (c) disclosed to or used by the public within the
    United States more than one year prior to filing.</p>
<p class="verySmall"><b>BY LAW YOU MUST DO THE FOLLOWING OR RISK ANY FUTURE RELATED PATENT BECOMING INVALID:</b>
    If you have related (in any way) US or foreign or international (e.g., a PCT) patent application prosecution which has discovered prior-art (e.g., in a search report or
    foreign patent office action) not already cited to the USPTO, then the USPTO requires that it must be promptly submitted in an Information
    Disclosure Statement (IDS). INVENTOR acknowledges its obligation to provide the USPTO with a list of the prior-art cited for filing under the IDS
    procedure. Generally, the USPTO requires the filing of an IDS with copies of all relevant publications (patents or otherwise) known to the inventor.
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    The IDS is usually filed before receiving the official filing receipt from the USPTO, yet may be filed at any time. If INVENTOR becomes aware of
    any references which are relevant to patentability during the pendency of the patent a Supplemental IDS should be filed disclosing the references;
    for example, in a related US patent application or a foreign patent office cites patents against a foreign counterpart of the US application. Likewise,
    the USPTO requires applicants to disclose to the USPTO, within 2 months of the filing date of any subsequent patent application filing, any patent
    applications that an applicant and/or (co)owner have filed, even if they are unrelated. Lack of this timely disclosure carries unspecified penalties
    and can harm your patent rights. INVENTOR acknowledges that it is imperative that INVENTOR timely disclose such information to the USPTO
    along with any patent filing. INVENTOR further acknowledges to timely provide the USPTO this information and notice even if INVENTOR
    believes PATENT FIRM should already be aware of the information for any reason; otherwise INVENTOR risks any future patent becoming being
    rendered invalid (e.g., by presumed inequitable conduct).
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    PATENT PENDING:
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    INVENTOR understands that it is illegal to claim patent pending status prior to the date a patent application is properly filed. A PPA provides
    patent pending status for one year from the filing date of the PPA and then expires. A PPA never becomes a patent. A utility patent that claims
    priority to the PPA must be filed by INVENTOR before the PPA expires- PATENT FIRM may not provide INVENTOR a deadline reminder.
    There is no PPA for design patents. If a utility or design patent application is to be filed by PATENT FIRM based on a PPA, INVENTOR must
    request a fee quote and fund such application within 9 months after the filing date of the PPA.
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    SUBMISSIONS:
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    INVENTOR agrees that AGENT will handle and is responsible for accepting, storing, managing, and/or returning any physical delivery of any kind
    of materials or properties contemplated under 37 CFR 112(c), which, for example, INVENTOR may wish to have received, maintained or returned
    related to the rendering of patent services. INVENTOR agrees that PATENT FIRM has no responsibility whatsoever to receive, maintain or return
    any of INVENTOR's physical material or properties, and AGENT will instead support INVENTOR in this regard.
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    NON-PUBLICATION:
</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    INVENTOR understands that if a foreign or international patent will be filed that claims priority to a US patent application then INVENTOR must
    allow the US patent application to be published by USPTO 18 months after the earliest US filing date. Otherwise, generally, if no foreign patent
    rights are sought by INVENTOR, INVENTOR should file a non-publication request with the USPTO. The non-publication request must be filed
    contemporaneous with the US Utility patent application, and can never be filed afterwards; however, it may be later rescinded. INVENTOR must
    indicate to PATENT FIRM that a non-publication request should be filed. If PATENT FIRM does not receive non-publication request instructions
    and corresponding signed/dated form from INVENTOR (no later than contemporaneous with INVENTOR's signed oath), PATENT FIRM will
    assume INVENTOR does not wish a non-publication request to be filed.

    The AIPLA economic Survey www.aipla.org developed and directed by the Law Practices Management Committee of the American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA) reports the annual income and related professional and demographic characteristics of intellectual property (IP) law attorney and associated patent agent. According to AIPLA 2015 Report the typical charge for US Utility / Design Patents are:
</p>
<ul class="verySmall">
    <li>Median (Average) Fee for drafting a utility Patent Application is seven thousand dollars ($7,000).</li>

<p class="verySmall">
    INVENTOR understands that maintenance fees are due every 3.5 to 4 years after a utility patent is issued by the USPTO. <strong class="verySmall">IT IS THE SOLE
        RESPONSIBILITY OF INVENTOR TO REMEMBER ALL FEES DUE DATES AND TIMELY PAY ALL FEES.  FAILURE TO PAY ANY

</p>
<p><strong><u class="verySmall">5.  Termination of PATENT FIRM's Representation</u></strong></p>
<p class="verySmall">
    At the time PATENT FIRM's representation of INVENTOR concludes, all unpaid fees and costs for Patent
    Services rendered become due and payable. PATENT FIRM will retain INVENTOR's files and any submitted materials (e.g.,
    without limitation, prototypes, photographs, drawings, etc.) for a period of one (1) month after the time of termination, beyond
    which PATENT FIRM may have the files and material destroyed or otherwise discarded. Upon conclusion of PATENT FIRM's
    representation, PATENT FIRM is no longer responsible for taking any further action (including, but not limited to, responding to
    USPTO Office Actions or filing of patent applications or attending to payment of maintenance or annuity fees) on INVENTOR's
    behalf. INVENTOR also acknowledges and agrees that if PATENT FIRM's representation is concluded, that PATENT FIRM may
    withdraw as INVENTOR's representative in any of INVENTOR’s matters, or administrative proceeding, or other matters before the
    USPTO or any other governing body (such as, without limitation, WIPO for PCT), and to substitute INVENTOR in said matter or
    proceeding as INVENTOR's own attorney.

    Furthermore, except to the extent prohibited by any applicable law, PATENT FIRM and INVENTOR further

<p><strong><u class="verySmall">8. Dispute Resolution</u></strong></p>
<p class="verySmall">COOPERATION; CERTAIN INVENTOR CLAIMS:</p>
<p class="verySmall">
    We do not anticipate having any disagreements with INVENTOR about the quality, cost or appropriateness of our
    services, but if any concerns about these matters arise, please notify us immediately. The parties agree to endeavor to resolve any
    disagreements in a fair and amicable manner. If, for some reason, the parties are not able to resolve any disputes raised by
    INVENTOR, then the parties acknowledge that PATENT FIRM and INVENTOR will litigate all disputes for which the USPTO
    has jurisdiction before the USPTO in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Patent Act 35 U.S.C. § 31 and 37 C.F.R. Part
    10, whereby the Commissioner of Patents may order that PATENT FIRM pay full or partial restitution to INVENTOR based on the
    merits of the case, or may indicate or determine that no action can or will be taken to resolve the dispute; whereby, PATENT FIRM
    and INVENTOR acknowledge that the Commissioner of Patent's judgment on the dispute, or decision that no action can or will be
    taken by the USPTO to resolve the dispute, may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction over the matter and INVENTOR will
    be estopped from bringing, in any court or dispute resolution forum, the same or any additional claims arising out of or related to
    the dispute against PATENT FIRM. In particular, PATENT FIRM and INVENTOR expressly waive any right to litigate in any
    court (including, but not limited to any small claims court, city, state, federal, or international court) any dispute, claim, or
    controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any other agreement executed and delivered pursuant to this
    Agreement, or the negotiation, breach, validity, termination or performance hereof and thereof or the transactions contemplated
    hereby and thereby, including claims related to work product quality, fraud or fraud in the inducement.
</p>
<p class="verySmall">MEDIATION:</p>
<p class="verySmall">Should the USPTO venue, judgment, or decision that no action will be taken be found to be unenforceable as a matter of
    law, or if PATENT FIRM is the initiatof a claim that results in a dispute, PATENT FIRM and INVENTOR acknowledge to, in
    good faith, settle the dispute through mediation in <?php echo e($attorney->location); ?> conducted by a mediator to be mutually selected. The
    initiating party will pay all costs of the mediator. Each party will cooperate fully and fairly with the mediator and will attempt to
    reach a mutually satisfactory compromise to the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days after it is referred to
    the mediator, then PATENT FIRM and INVENTOR may initiate an arbitration as specified herein.
</p>
<p class="verySmall">ARBITRATION:</p>
<p class="verySmall">All disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any other agreement executed and delivered
    pursuant to this Agreement, or the negotiation, breach, validity, termination or performance hereof and thereof or the transactions
    contemplated hereby and thereby, that are not resolved by mutual agreement, or as prescribed above, shall be resolved solely and
    exclusively by binding arbitration to be conducted before the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") or its successor. The
    parties understand and agree that this arbitration provision shall apply equally to claims of fraud or fraud in the inducement. The
    arbitration shall be held in <?php echo e($attorney->location); ?> before a single arbitrator and shall be conducted in accordance with the
    Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA, unless specifically modified herein. The arbitration shall comply with and be governed
    by the provisions of the <?php echo e(explode(',',$attorney->location)[1]); ?> Arbitration Act, <?php echo e(explode(',',$attorney->location)[1]); ?> Code of Civil Procedure sections 1280 1294.2. The parties covenant
    and agree that the arbitration shall commence within sixty (60) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is filed by
    any party hereto, unless an extension of time is mutually agreed upon by all parties to the arbitration proceeding. In connection
    with the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall have the power to order the production of documents by each party and any
    third-party witnesses. In addition, each party may take a single depositions as of right, and the arbitrator may in his or her
    discretion allow additional depositions upon good cause shown by the moving party. However, the arbitrator shall not have the
    power to order the answering of interrogatories or the response to requests for admission. In connection with any arbitration, each
    party shall provide to the other, no later than fourteen (14) business days before the date of the arbitration, the identity of all persons
    that may testify at the arbitration (other than rebuttal witnesses), a copy of all documents (other than rebuttal documents) that may
    be introduced at the arbitration or considered or used by a party's witness or expert, and a summary of the expert's opinions and the
    basis for said opinions (other than rebuttal expert summaries). The arbitrator shall have the right to determine a fair amount of time
    for the preparation and submission of rebuttal documents and rebuttal expert summaries. The arbitrator's decision and award shall
    be made and delivered within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the arbitration. The arbitrator's decision shall set forth a reasoned
    basis for any award of damages or finding of liability. The parties covenant and agree that they will participate in the arbitration in
    good faith. All parties to the arbitration agree to pay their own costs and expenses related to or arising from the arbitration process
    (including without limitation, travel, and attorney's fees). The initiating party of the dispute will pay the fees and expenses charged
    by AAA. This Section 9 applies equally to requests for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief, except that in the
    case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the limited purpose of
    avoiding immediate and irreparable harm. The provisions of this Section 9 shall be enforceable in any court of competent
    jurisdiction.
